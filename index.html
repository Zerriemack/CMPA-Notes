          Right now I am a student focused on building new skills and strengthening my foundation across multiple disciplines.
          I enjoy working through problems step by step, then turning what I learn into something practical I can test and improve.
          I also use GitHub to keep my work organized and to build better habits around documentation and consistency.

          My goals are straightforward, but I take them seriously. I want to graduate and step into a role that lets me use my full range of skills,
          especially when it comes to analysis and project work. Long term, I want to build something of my own that keeps growing into a real personal project
          with real value.
