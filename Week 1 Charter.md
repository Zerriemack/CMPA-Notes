## Course Goals

1. Learn how to write clean Markdown for assignments, documentation, and project notes.
2. Learn the basics of Git and GitHub so I can save my work, track changes, and build a simple portfolio.
3. Build a repeatable workflow for creating and documenting small tech projects I can reuse for DFS and sports analytics.

## Potential Challenges

- Feeling overwhelmed by new tools at the start (Git commands, repositories, formatting rules).
- Staying consistent with weekly work when life gets busy.
- Overthinking early drafts instead of getting something submitted and improving it later.
