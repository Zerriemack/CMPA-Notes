      <p>
        Right now I am a student focused on learning new skills and building a stronger
        foundation across multiple disciplines. I enjoy working through problems step by step
        and turning ideas into systems I can test and improve. I am also building projects in
        GitHub to sharpen my documentation and technical workflow.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goals are straightforward. I want to graduate, land a role where I can use a wide
        range of skills, and keep developing my strengths in analytics and project work. Long
        term, I want to build something of my own that can grow into a real personal project
        with real value.
